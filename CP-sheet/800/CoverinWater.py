APPROACH
If there are 3 consecutive empty cells i−1
, i
, i+1
, we can place water in cells i−1
 and i+1
 and then move water from cell i
 to all other cells. If there are no such cells, we have to place water on every empty cell.

So if we find substring ''...'' in the array, the answer is 2
, otherwise the answer is the number of empty cells.

Time and memory complexities are O(N)
.
